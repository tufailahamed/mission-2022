            <p class="first-paragraph">I am Md. Tufail Ahamed. I have completed my graduation in Textile Engineering and
                Management from BGMAEA University of Fashion & Technology. After completing my graduation I worked as a
                Junior IE Executive Iris Fabrics Ltd. During that time I realised that I have no passion for my work.
                From that moment I
                always try to discover a profession which I really loved. Finally I took my decision and enrolled myself
                Programming Hero Web Development course. </p>

                        is, not what you think it should be". </p>

            <h2>Leading </h2>
            <h2>Without Limits</h2>
            <p>From learning without limits to leading without limits: An autobiographical reflective case study of
                leading academic development with higher education. This autobiographical case study reflects upon how a
                senior academic leader repurposed the Learning without Limits pedagogical framework originally developed
                within UK primary and secondary school settings to inform the development of a new transformational
                leadership framework within a higher education setting. Kolb’s Experiential Learning Cycle is used to
                structure an analytically self-reflective account of the leadership behaviours deployed for a
                distributed model of academic development to be effective, viewed through the lens of Learning without
                Limits. As a result, a new framework to inform effective approaches to the leadership of change in
                higher education is suggested: Leading without Limits.</p>

            <h2>Connect with</h2>
            <h2>Global Community</h2>
            <p>If you want to grow as a developer, I can't over-emphasize the benefits of joining a developer community.
                There are many advantages, from peer-programming to sharing knowledge, mentorship, sharing support,
                sharing tools, code reviews, answering questions, and much more. Communities are usually built on shared
                struggles of individuals learning in a particular region, and the goals of each community differ per the
                individual's collective needs. Over the years, these developer communities have grown across the world
                with different goals and missions but still with the general aim of providing a platform for developers
                to learn, interact, share ideas, support each other and grow. "If you want to go quickly, go alone. If
                you want to go far, go together." – African Proverb</p>
