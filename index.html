            <p class="first-paragraph">I am Md. Tufail Ahamed. I have completed my graduation in Textile Engineering and
                Management from BGMAEA University of Fashion & Technology. After completing my graduation I worked as a
                Junior IE Executive Iris Fabrics Ltd. During that time I realised that I have no passion for my work.
                From that moment I
                always try to discover a profession which I really loved. Finally I took my decision and enrolled myself
                Programming Hero Web Development course. </p>
